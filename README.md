# Zoo-Management
### Design of a system for tracking information about animals in a zoo.
- Animals:
- Horses (horses, zebras, donkeys, etc.),
- Felines (tigers, lions, etc.),
- It is characterized by species in groups such as rodents (rats, beavers, etc.).
- Most of the information stored about animals is the same for all groupings. (species name, weight, age, etc.)
- The system should also be able to get the dosage of specific drugs for each animal => getDosage()
- System should be able to calculate Feed times => getFeedSchedule()
